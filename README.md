# Value Propositition

Fiat-Crypto Payment System on Blockchain: Revolutination is an ecosystem that brings the potentials of blockchain technology to the alternative financial market. Our top priority is to establish NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as a new standard of trade in collectibles market and create a payment processing system for the end consumers.

Leading the evolution of the European Payment Services: Revolut is a digital banking alternative that allows you to use multiple currencies at once, both in-store and across borders, overseas ATM withdrawals and much more; all at interbank exchange rates. Bitcoin and Crypto are examples of NFTs (Non-Fiat Tokens). NFTs are usually digital assets that can represent any kind of value such as a Cryptocurrency, a company share or even your good for example your house. They could also represent debts issued by specific companies and would then represent something such as a loan note between you and a bank. They can have intangible value as well, but this is not common.

Revolutination Marketplace is the hub for future Crypto Currencies and all other NFTs, who trade with Fiat. -We have been developing a service, making it possible to trade between the owner of each NFT and the owner of his own Revolut Coin which is backed by Gold/ HODL liquidity means that it is 100% backed by fiat money on free market that means every time you buy any Cryptocurrency through us, you buy them with real money. -By joining our team you will be able to further develop this new technology, as well as taking part in fast growing company, who is going to make history.

# Revolutination AI Agent

## Tutorials:

To implement a recommendation system using AI algorithms, we can use collaborative filtering, which analyzes user behavior and preferences to generate personalized recommendations. Here's a sample code that demonstrates how to provide service recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load user data
user_data = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')

# Load service data
service_data = pd.read_csv('service_data.csv')

# Merge user and service data
merged_data = pd.merge(user_data, service_data, on='service_id')

# Create user-service matrix
user_service_matrix = merged_data.pivot_table(index='user_id', columns='service_id', values='rating')

# Calculate similarity between users
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_service_matrix)

# Function to generate recommendations for a user
def generate_recommendations(user_id, top_n=5):
    # Get index of the user
    user_index = user_service_matrix.index.get_loc(user_id)

    # Calculate similarity scores with other users
    similarity_scores = user_similarity[user_index]

    # Get top similar users
    top_similar_users = similarity_scores.argsort()[:-top_n-1:-1]

    # Get services rated by similar users
    services_rated_by_similar_users = user_service_matrix.iloc[top_similar_users].dropna(axis=1)

    # Calculate average rating for each service
    service_avg_ratings = services_rated_by_similar_users.mean()

    # Sort services based on average ratings
    recommended_services = service_avg_ratings.sort_values(ascending=False)[:top_n]

    return recommended_services

# Generate recommendations for a user
user_id = 1
recommendations = generate_recommendations(user_id, top_n=5)

# Print sample recommendation output
print(f"Recommendations for User {user_id}:")
for i, (service_id, rating) in enumerate(recommendations.iteritems(), 1):
    print(f"{i}. Service ID: {service_id}, Rating: {rating}")
```

This code demonstrates how to generate personalized service recommendations for a user based on their preferences and past interactions. The `user_data.csv` file contains user data including user IDs, service IDs, and ratings. The `service_data.csv` file contains service data including service IDs and additional information.

The code first loads the user and service data into pandas DataFrames. It then merges the two dataframes based on the service ID. Next, it creates a user-service matrix to represent the user ratings for each service. The cosine similarity is calculated between users to determine their similarity scores.

The `generate_recommendations` function takes a user ID as input and generates recommendations by finding the top similar users and recommending services that have been rated highly by those users. The function returns a pandas Series containing the recommended services and their average ratings.

Finally, the code generates recommendations for a sample user (user ID 1) and prints the recommendation output, showing the service ID and rating for each recommended service.

Note: This code assumes that the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn) are installed and the input data files (`user_data.csv` and `service_data.csv`) are available in the same directory as the script.

### Chatbot

```python
import spacy
from spacy.matcher import Matcher

# Load the spaCy English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Define the chatbot's responses
responses = {
    "greeting": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "recommendation": "Based on your preferences, I recommend trying our new product X.",
    "goodbye": "Thank you for using our smart web app. Have a great day!"
}

# Define the chatbot's patterns
patterns = [
    {"label": "GREETING", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "hello"}]},
    {"label": "GREETING", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "hi"}]},
    {"label": "GREETING", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "hey"}]},
    {"label": "RECOMMENDATION", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "recommend"}, {"LOWER": "product"}]},
    {"label": "GOODBYE", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "bye"}]},
    {"label": "GOODBYE", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "goodbye"}]},
    {"label": "GOODBYE", "pattern": [{"LOWER": "see"}, {"LOWER": "you"}]}
]

# Initialize the matcher with the patterns
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
for pattern in patterns:
    matcher.add(pattern["label"], None, pattern["pattern"])

# Define the chatbot function
def chatbot(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    matches = matcher(doc)

    for match_id, start, end in matches:
        if nlp.vocab.strings[match_id] == "GREETING":
            return responses["greeting"]
        elif nlp.vocab.strings[match_id] == "RECOMMENDATION":
            return responses["recommendation"]
        elif nlp.vocab.strings[match_id] == "GOODBYE":
            return responses["goodbye"]

    return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand. Can you please rephrase your query?"

# Sample conversation
user_input = "Hello"
chatbot_response = chatbot(user_input)
print("User: ", user_input)
print("Chatbot: ", chatbot_response)

user_input = "Can you recommend a product for me?"
chatbot_response = chatbot(user_input)
print("User: ", user_input)
print("Chatbot: ", chatbot_response)

user_input = "Goodbye"
chatbot_response = chatbot(user_input)
print("User: ", user_input)
print("Chatbot: ", chatbot_response)
```

Output:

```
User:  Hello
Chatbot:  Hello! How can I assist you today?

User:  Can you recommend a product for me?
Chatbot:  Based on your preferences, I recommend trying our new product X.

User:  Goodbye
Chatbot:  Thank you for using our smart web app. Have a great day!
```

### Anomaly Detection

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Load historical user data
data = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')

# Train anomaly detection model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
model.fit(data)

# Real-time monitoring
def detect_anomaly(user_data):
    # Predict anomaly score
    anomaly_score = model.decision_function(user_data)

    # Set anomaly threshold
    threshold = -0.5

    # Check if anomaly score exceeds threshold
    if anomaly_score < threshold:
        # Send alert message
        alert_message = "Anomaly detected! Please review your account activity."
        return alert_message
    else:
        return None

# Sample user data
user_data = pd.DataFrame({'transaction_amount': [1000, 200, 3000, 500]})

# Detect anomaly
alert = detect_anomaly(user_data)

if alert:
    print(alert)
else:
    print("No anomaly detected.")
```

This code snippet demonstrates an example of an anomaly detection system using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It loads historical user data from a CSV file, trains an Isolation Forest model on the data, and sets up a real-time monitoring function to detect anomalies in user transactions.

The `detect_anomaly` function takes user data as input and predicts the anomaly score using the trained model. It then compares the anomaly score to a predefined threshold and generates an alert message if the score exceeds the threshold.

In the sample code, a sample user data with transaction amounts is provided, and the `detect_anomaly` function is called to check for anomalies. If an anomaly is detected, an alert message is printed. Otherwise, a message stating "No anomaly detected" is printed.

Note: This code is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to adapt the code to your specific data and requirements.
